# Probing the Lower Mass Limit for Supernova Progenitors and the High-Mass End of the Initial-Final Mass Relation from White Dwarfs in the Open Cluster M35 (NGC 2168)


## Abstract

> We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the white dwarf (WD) population of the populous, intermediate-age open cluster M35 (NGC 2168); this study expands upon our previous study of the WDs in this cluster. We spectroscopically confirm 14 WDs in the field of the cluster: 12 DAs, 1 hot DQ, and 1 DB star. For each DA, we determine the WD mass and cooling age, from which we derive each star's progenitor mass. These data are then added to the empirical initial-final mass relation (IFMR), where the M35 WDs contribute significantly to the high-mass end of the relation. The resulting points are consistent with previously published linear fits to the IFMR, modulo moderate systematics introduced by the uncertainty in the star cluster age. Based on this cluster alone, the observational lower limit on the maximum mass of WD progenitors is found to be ~5.1 M sun - 5.2 M sun at the 95% confidence level; including data from other young open clusters raises this limit to as high as 7.1 M sun, depending on the cluster membership of three massive WDs and the core composition of the most massive WDs. We find that the apparent distance modulus and extinction derived solely from the cluster WDs ((m - M) V = 10.45 ± 0.08 and E(B-V) = 0.185 ± 0.010, respectively) is fully consistent with that derived from main-sequence fitting techniques. Four M35 WDs may be massive enough to have oxygen-neon cores; the assumed core composition does not significantly affect the empirical IFMR. Finally, the two non-DA WDs in M35 are photometrically consistent with cluster membership; further analysis is required to determine their memberships. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.

# Semi-empirical White Dwarf Initial-Final Mass Relationships: A Thorough Analysis of Systematic Uncertainties Due to Stellar Evolution Models


## Abstract

> Using the most recent results about white dwarfs (WDs) in ten open clusters, we revisit semiempirical estimates of the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) in star clusters, with emphasis on the use of stellar evolution models. We discuss the influence of these models on each step of the derivation. One intention of our work is to use consistent sets of calculations both for the isochrones and the WD cooling tracks. The second one is to derive the range of systematic errors arising from stellar evolution theory. This is achieved by using different sources for the stellar models and by varying physical assumptions and input data. We find that systematic errors, including the determination of the cluster age, are dominating the initial mass values, while observational uncertainties influence the final mass primarily. After having determined the systematic errors, the initial-final mass relation allows us finally to draw conclusions about the physics of the stellar models, in particular about convective overshooting.

# Revision of the initial-to-final mass relation


## Abstract

> The initial-to final mass relation is revised in view of new theoretical and observational data. Recent stellar evolution models predict core masses at the beginning of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch which practically coincide with final white dwarf masses derived for NGC 3532 and the binary white dwarf PG 0922+162. The Hyades white dwarfs must be relocated at higher initial masses since Hipparcos data lead to a reduced cluster age, and move also closer to the first TP relation. Comparison with theoretically predicted initial to final mass relations support the new evolutionary models with exponential diffusive overshoot which undergo core mass reduction by a strong third dredge-up. The upper mass limit for C/O white dwarf production is smaller than hitherto assumed, around 6.5 Msun with white dwarf masses below 1 Msun. More massive white dwarfs must have Ne/O cores after off-center carbon burning or are due to mergers or rotational lifting. Differential mass loss seems to be small thus justifying the use of an universal Mi/Mf relation for calculations of stellar and galactic evolution. It differs from the widely used 1987 relation and is steeper especially in the mass range from 3 to 4 Msun
